### (println "Hello, world.")

I'm a data-oriented software developer. My software interests are
generally all over the place but all centering around representation,
modeling, collection, storage, transformation, visualization, and
interaction of data.

Currently interested in collaborative software and CRDTs, working on
transitioning my personal machines to NixOS, and hopefully standing up
a few professional-portfolio related things (e.g. this readme, some
blogging, and actually deploying my hobby work).
