### (println "Hello, world.")

I'm a data-oriented software developer. My software interests are
generally all over the place but all centering around representation,
modeling, collection, storage, transformation, visualization, and
interaction of data.

I don't do much publicly-visible coding but I'm hoping to change that
in the coming year. My goal for 2025 Q1 is to express myself more and 
doing more visible on the internet is going to be part of that.

Currently looking into starting a blog, creating an add-on in 
World of Warcraft, and trying out live-streaming.

I'm also looking for a new position. If you think there's a fit, feel 
free to reach out to my email.
